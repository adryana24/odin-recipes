	<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Pasta carbonara is one of those simple dinners we should all know how to make. It’s the perfect go-to for a busy weeknight, and it’s also a dish fit for the weekend or even to serve to guests. This recipe works so well because pasta is boiled in less water with to really concentrate the starches, which will help bind everything in the sauce and prevent separation when you add it to the egg mixture.</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Bacon</li>
			<li>Spaghetti</li>
			<li>Parmesan</li>
			<li>Garlic</li>
			<li>Eggs</li>
			<li>Salt and Pepper</li>
		</ul>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Add bacon and water to a skillet and bring to a simmer.</li>
			<li>Continue simmering until water is evaporated, then continue to cook the bacon until crispy.</li>
			<li>Remove bacon from pan and reserve the drippings.</li>
			<li>Saute garlic in that same skillet until golden brown, then add to a bowl with 1 tablespoon bacon fat, eggs, egg yolk, Parmesan and pepper. Mix well.</li>
